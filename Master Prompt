Objective:
Develop an online application that allows salespeople to quickly and efficiently:

Check the overall margin for a specific sales order.

View individual line item margins within that order.

Run specialized margin queries/checks on categories such as Project Management, Design, etc.

Access valuable contextual data to improve quoting accuracy and profitability.

Tech Stack Preferences:

Backend: Node.js (Express.js) or Python (FastAPI)

Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS

Database: PostgreSQL (existing synced ERP data)

ORM/Query library: Prisma (Node.js) or SQLAlchemy (Python)

Database Context:

Tables:

public.ods_hds_orderheader (order summary, total sell, total cost)

public.ods_hds_orderline (line details, sell price, cost price, product category)

Functional Requirements:

Primary Margin Analysis:

Input: Order Number

Output:

Order-level margin %

Line-level details (product, description, sell, cost, margin %)

Category-Based Margin Checks:

Summarize margins for:

Project Management

Design

Additional relevant product categories

Enhanced Sales Insights:

Historical similar quotes comparison

Recommended margin ranges based on historical data

Real-time approval requests for margin exceptions

Upselling and cross-selling suggestions based on past orders

Customer margin history overview

Salesperson performance indicators (margin targets vs. actuals)

Automated discount guardrails and warnings

Competitive pricing insights (manual or internal benchmarking data)

Commission forecasting based on current quote margins

Quote-to-order conversion probability analysis

Technical Considerations:

Optimize queries for performance; queries must execute rapidly (use indexing)

Limit results strictly by user-provided Order Number

Develop as RESTful or GraphQL endpoints

Deliverables (First Phase):

Initial backend API endpoints for margin calculations by Order Number

Basic interactive frontend page for inputting order numbers and displaying margins

SQL queries optimized and structured clearly for ongoing maintenance and scaling

Future Phases:

Enhanced frontend interactivity (sorting/filtering tables, margin highlighting)

Real-time alerts and notifications on margin deviations

Integration with CRM (Salesforce) or BI Tools (Superset/Noloco)

Next Steps:

Propose detailed API endpoint design

Identify necessary database indices and performance enhancements

Suggest a frontend prototype layout

Outline security measures for sensitive margin data access
